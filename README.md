# IoT-mini-project 
### Group 33 - Muhammad Ahmad, Syed Ali, Alpo Kosunen

## 1. Setting up the environment

After receiving the credentials for the FIT IoT-Lab we were able to create SSH keys and connect to it. I created a project folder to where I would later create the main.c file containing the application code and the Makefile needed for RIOT OS compiling. Because of this subject is not very familiar to us we selected the project to be about a simple IoT device that reads temperature and ambient pressure from its surroundings and then transmitss it to the cloud where the data would be formed to a graph.
